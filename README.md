This application is a weather app built in Swift using SwiftUI as a practice project. It uses Async/Await calls to perform data fetching from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API. The users location can be used if permissions are granted or can search for a city using the OpenWeatherMap GeoLocation API. 

All of the views dynamically update their backgrounds based on the local time of the weather data.
